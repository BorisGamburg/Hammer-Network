Hammer Network: The Piranha Swarm
Stop feeding the financial aircraft carriers. It's time for the swarm.

The Vision
The global financial system is dominated by giants. We don't fight them head-on; we dissolve them. Hammer Network is a decentralized, autonomous infrastructure designed for the "little guy." We use a "Piranha" tactic: millions of small, relentless bites that no corporate armor can withstand.

Technical Concept: The Swarm Logic
Micro-Instance Proliferation: Every node runs ~100 micro-bots.

The 0.2% Rule: We don't chase "moons." We take 0.2% profit, thousands of times a day. Mathematically inevitable growth.

Hardware Independence: Built for $20 Android TV boxes, Orange Pi, and old laptops. If it has a CPU, it can be a part of the swarm.

Zero Infrastructure: No central servers. No VPS. No clouds. A physical node in every home.

We Are Looking For:
I am Boris Gamburg, and I am looking for co-conspirators, not employees. If you still believe that code should be a tool for freedom, I need your help:

Python Architects: To optimize the swarm core for low-end hardware.

Embedded Linux Experts: To create a "burn-and-run" OS image for ARM devices.

DEX/Web3 Ninjas: To ensure our movements are invisible and decentralized.

Join the Resistance
This is an Open Source project for the people. No KYC. No corporate bullshit.
